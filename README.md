# ALS Data Cleaning Tool
A coding tool developed in R to take water analysis results exported from the [ALS WEBTRIEVEâ„¢ data portal](https://webtrieveus.alsenviro.com/Login.aspx). Exported data are cleaned, merged, and exported into archiving (e.g., CSV) or visual (e.g., HTML) formats. The tool also merges data produced in-house (i.e., pH, Total Suspended Soilds, and Specific Electrical Conductivity) with the final exported data. **Before using, please see the [data disclosure statement](#data-disclosure-statement-for-als-data-cleaning-tool) below.**

## <u>Repo Contents</u>
* **Code**
    * **file-merger.R** - a script that takes the raw files from ALS, cleans the data, and exports as a dataframe and/or CSV file for other uses
    * **site_selector.Rmd** - a markdown script that produces an HTML report with interactive data visualization and optional data export for a specific research site location as chosen by the user
    * **water_report.Rmd** - a markdown script that produces a summary of all water quality data for all sites on a YTD basis
* **Data**
    * a folder containing example data to use in script execution ([please see data disclosure statement](#data-disclosure-statement-for-als-data-cleaning-tool)).
* **figures**
    * a folder containing the AWQP logo for use in this README.
* **Report**
    * a folder containing the resulting HMTL report that result from execution of the "water_report.Rmd" script.
    * *Please note* that this is not where the HTML report is generated, but rather where it was moved after generation. It is currently generated in the Code folder, which is an ongoing bug to be addressed at a later time.
* **site_selector_temporary_results**
    * a folder containing the resulting HMTL report and CSV file that result from execution of the "site_selector.Rmd" script.
    * *Please note* that this is not where the HTML report is generated, but rather where it was moved after generation. It is currently generated in the Code folder, which is an ongoing bug to be addressed at a later time. **The CSV**, however, *is* generated in this folder upon execution.
* **TSS**
    * a separate folder where an excel file exists containing example total suspended solids, electrical conductivity, and pH data is stored in the format congruent with what AWQP staff use in-house.  It is in a separate folder because this mimics the true deployment of this code outside of the github repo.
* **ALS_Data_Cleaning_Tool.Rproj**
    * the R project file used to open the codebase into the correct directory for Rstudio.  Double click this file to begin using the coding tool in Rstudio.
* **AWQP Water Processing ID Key 2023**
    * a separate excel file that details the ID protocols used to label each water sample, that is the basis for this codebase to dissect information back into a more useable format.
## <u>Some Helpful Troubleshooting Notes</u>

* Currently, the output HTML reports get generated in the /Code folder and need to be moved manually to other locations (in this case "Reports" or "site_selector_temporary_results").

* ALS exports data as ".xls" file format in name only.  The actual result files are in ".htm" format.  The sample metadata, however is actually in ".xls" format, as found on the "samples" tab.

* If you edit the .htm file from ALS in excel and save it, it corrupts the file and cannot then be imported.  This occurred for us once when we tried to edit an erroneous date.

* When running file-merger.R, which occurs in all the markdown scripts, you CANNOT have the TSS excel file open, else an error will occur

* It is helpful to create a "Confidential Data" forlder in the repo you fork, to run the code locally with real data.  This avoids copy/pasting the entire repo elsewhere to operate it.

## <u>Future Developments</u>
* Overall
    * Automate the emailing of the report(s) after generation
    * fix the issue with HTML reports being saved in /Code folder
    * ~~Create confidential data folder to run using real ALS data~~
    * ~~create confidential TSS folder to run using real data~~
* file-merger
    * Add integration of separate excel file results when ALS Houston exports work to other ALS labs (e.g., when Selenium analysis is requested.)
    * Fix sample hold time flag "H" in flagData funciton in file_merger.R
    * Add GPS coordinates dictionary to assign coordinates to each location and treatment (as necessary)
* water_report
    * Create table of methods used in introduction
    * See if we can parse Kerbel results by treatment
    * fix Kerbel inflow/outflow not being colorized properly
* site_selector
    * Create table of methods used in introduction
    * Set the plotly plots to start at the correct y range
    * Fix scatter plotly plot points for Point Sample on the violin plot
    * Potentially create a way to run the functions for multiple sites
    * Add histograms and correlations to scatterplot matrix
    * Put analyte labels outside of the scatterplot matrix and shorten their names with a analyte dict. 
    * ~~Fix mutate error in scatterplot matrix~~
