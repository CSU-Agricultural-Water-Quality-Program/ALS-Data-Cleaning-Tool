# ALS Data Cleaning Tool
R script to take water analysis results exported from the [ALS WEBTRIEVEâ„¢ data portal](https://webtrieveus.alsenviro.com/Login.aspx) and then clean, merge, and export the data into a more useable format for the Colorado State University Agricultural Water Quality Program. The script can be used as a library for other scripts (e.g., for analysis and graphing), or simply used to export data for archiving.

Note: ALS exports data as ".xls" file format in name only.  The actual files are in ".htm" format.  This is just a helpful tip for users working with these data
